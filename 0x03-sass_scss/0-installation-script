# Installation Anywhere (Optional)- Windows in this case

## *Install SASS by using the following command if you have node installed*:

### npm install sass -v 3.7.4
### npm install -g sass to install it global

## Troubleshooting
- If sass still isn't recognized, try:

bash
- npx sass 0-debug_log.scss
(This runs sass without global installation.)

- If you're using Windows PowerShell or CMD, try:

sh
where sass
(This checks if sass is in PATH.)
