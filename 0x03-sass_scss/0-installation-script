Installation Anywhere (Optional)- Windows in this case

Install SASS by using the following command if you have node installed:

npm install sass -v 3.7.4
npm install -g sass to install it globally

Troubleshooting
- If sass still isn't recognized, try:

bash
- npx sass 0-debug_log.scss
(This runs sass without global installation.)

- If you're using Windows PowerShell or CMD, try:
sh

where sass
(This checks if sass is in PATH.)

2.
This command is a Unix/Linux shell command that does two things:

sass 1-color_variable.scss

Compiles the SCSS file (1-color_variable.scss) into CSS using the Sass compiler.

By default, Sass outputs the compiled CSS to the terminal (stdout).

| tail -n +2

The | (pipe) sends Sass's output to the tail command.

tail -n +2 means:

Start displaying from line 2 (skip the first line).

If the input has 5 lines, it shows lines 2â€“5.

If the input has only 1 line, it shows nothing (since +2 is beyond the total lines).

for windows: sass 1-color_variable.scss | tail -n +2
